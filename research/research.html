                        We have redesigned how conventional PPE should look, aiming to mark this as a "mainstream

                        was able to foster the quirkiest PPE you could have ever seen. Packed with features which users

                        From wearing an entire suit of plastic, we knew which part of the body needed to be protected.
                        Cutting off the avoidable clothing we made Swasner not only economical but also fashionable. We
                        didn't want to bring something obscure in front of people thus tried to make the design akin to
                        just another hoodie.

                        We kept the shoulder short for restriction free movement. To avoid any leaks our product comes
                        with stretchable elastics on shoulder and waist cuts. In front we kept opening with gloves
                        attached inside, to access the face without breaking the bio-bubble.

                        purified air around the person for ease in respiration and reducing perspiration to rock bottom.

                        Swasner was meant to last, and it was always our priority. We made prototypes wondering upon
                        varied cloth materials .Factors we had to consider in this selection procedure were :
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub_descriptive_pargh">
                        1. Imperviable : First target was to make swasner an all weather product, and for this we had to
                        make it with a cloth material being hydrophobic in nature.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub_descriptive_pargh">
                        2. Breathable : This was our first barrier as both these features were contradictory to each
                        other, so we tried to minimize the thickness of the fabric to the least. As our target audience
                        were frontline workers, we needed to keep in mind about the heating issue inside Swasner.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub_descriptive_pargh">
                        3. Comfortable : As there were regions where the fabric came in direct contact with the skin, we
                        improvised to make it comfortable by adding another layer of fabric inside. We tested different
                        options like : mesh cloth, Astar etc.
                    </p>
                    <p class="sub_descriptive_pargh">
                        4. Fashionable : And our ultimate aim was to break the stereotype of PPE. This could have only
                        been done by making Swasner a fashion statement. Our team after several iterations accepted the
                        fabric which survived in all the requirements and still had an aesthetic feature to it.
